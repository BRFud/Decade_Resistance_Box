# Panel Legend Notes

Some notes on the contents of these files.

The original is the SVG, created using Inkscape  0.48.  It has many layers for the different elements and alignment marks.  You should be able to get the desired combination of markings by turning on and off the layers.

There have been some field reports about people having trouble opening the SVG, so the most important layers were also saved in a PDF, with the text converted to paths, to remove any dependency on having fonts installed.  Adobe Acrobat should be able to open and print the file - more capable tools (Illustrator, CorelDraw) should also be able to edit it.
